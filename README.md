# CODSOFT-Spam_SMS_Detection-
This project uses machine learning to classify SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam). It involves text preprocessing (like removing stopwords, punctuation, and vectorizing using TF-IDF), and training a model using algorithms like Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression for accurate prediction
